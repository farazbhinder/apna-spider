To download the images of a book from http://apnaorg.com website, as it is difficult to read books on their web interface. 
So we can use this script to download all the images of a book and make a pdf of them to read easily, on mobile devices etc.

example run:
`python apna-spider.py "Khed Muqadaran Di" "255" "http://apnaorg.com/books/shahmukhi/raja-1/book.php?fldr=book"`
